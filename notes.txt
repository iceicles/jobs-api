In postman, you can setup access token with auth headers dynamically by using this command in Scripts tab - 

const jsonData = pm.response.json()
pm.globals.set("accessToken", jsonData.token);


then in Authorization tab, for any route, choose 'Bearer Token' from the drop down and select {{accessToken}} which is the newly created global variable
